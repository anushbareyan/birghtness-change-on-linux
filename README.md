# birghtnesschangeonlinux
This repository contains two simple scripts for changing the brightness level of a linux-based system.

On my Manjaro linux I had trouble changing the brightness because of the the device compatibility. I changed the brightness in terminal by setting the brightness to a specific percentage using xrandr. Also I found the command to get the current birghtness level, so I decided to use those 2 commands to create decrease/increase scripts in zsh and bind them to keys using Manjaro custom shortcuts. 

This works on X11 systems.
